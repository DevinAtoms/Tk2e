# PY2E
## What is this?

Its my attempt at building an app of sorts for Pathfinder 2E.

This was mostly born out of a weird lack of apps for P2E, but also serves as practice for working with Python data structures and JSON

## Goals

- Parse JSON export from Hero Lab Online
>This is where I'm at right now. Currently able to pull Spells into a Python List formatted as ['name', 'description', 'range']. Still need to work out exception handling as not every field is filled in. I may be able to work around this using a Pandas DataFrame, but we'll see.

- Export to File
  - PDF
  - CSV
  - HTML?
  - Anything else that strikes my fancy
 
 - Maybe implementing the math to do skill checks and attacks using character's attributes
