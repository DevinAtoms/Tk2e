# PY2E

Its my attempt at building an app of sorts for Pathfinder 2E.

## Why?

This was mostly born out of a weird lack of apps for P2E, but also serves as practice for working with Python data structures and JSON

>Anything past this point is speculative. If I manage to get to this point, I'd probably try to implement more game logic and math for skill checks/attack rolls.
