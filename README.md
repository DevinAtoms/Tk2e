# PY2E

Its my attempt at building an app of sorts for Pathfinder 2E with a Tkinter based GUI

## Why?

This was mostly born out of a weird lack of apps for P2E, but also serves as practice for working with Python data structures, JSON, and basic GUI design.

## Status

urrent has a functional Spell List GUI, requires a JSON file containing a HeroLab online export.
