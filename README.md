# PY2E

Its my attempt at building an app of sorts for Pathfinder 2E.

## Why?

This was mostly born out of a weird lack of apps for P2E, but also serves as practice for working with Python data structures and JSON.

## Status

I haven't done anything with this for a while, but I'm going to try revisiting it. Current has a functional Spell List GUI, requires a JSON file containing a HeroLab online export.
