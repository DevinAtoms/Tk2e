# PY2E

Its my attempt at building an app of sorts for Pathfinder 2E.

## Why?

This was mostly born out of a weird lack of apps for P2E, but also serves as practice for working with Python data structures and JSON.

I actually can't say for sure if this is going to go anywhere in it's current state. I've taken to working in Dart/Flutter and I'm reconsidering my approach to filling the niche that I'm looking for.
