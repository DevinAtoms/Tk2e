# PY2E
## What is this?

Its my attempt at building an app of sorts for Pathfinder 2E.

This was mostly born out of a weird lack of apps for P2E, but also serves as practice for working with Python data structures and JSON

## Goals
### Sub items are in no particular order

- [x] Parse JSON export from Hero Lab Online
- [ ] Export parsed data into a format that's usable
  - [ ] Spells
  - [ ] Ability Scores
  - [ ] Equipment
  - [ ] Skills
  - [ ] Feats/Class Abilities

- [ ] Export to File
  - [ ] PDF
  - [ ] CSV
  - [ ] HTML?
  - [ ] Anything else that strikes my fancy
 
 - [ ] Maybe implementing the math for attack rolls and skill checks
