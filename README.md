# PY2E

Its my attempt at building an app of sorts for Pathfinder 2E.

## Why?

This was mostly born out of a weird lack of apps for P2E, but also serves as practice for working with Python data structures and JSON.

I actually can't say for sure if this is going to go anywhere in it's current state. I've taken to working in Dart/Flutter and I'm reconsidering my approach to filling the niche that I'm looking for.

>Anything past this point is speculative. If I manage to get to this point, I'd probably try to implement more game logic and math for skill checks/attack rolls.
